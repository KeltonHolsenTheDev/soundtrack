## Description:

SoundTrack is an event-planning app geared towards technicians who need to track their organization's staff and inventory. 
The app allows administrators to manage inventory, staff and locations for the organization, and to use that information
to plan events, including what equipment or volunteers will be present at which events. The app makes sure that the user
can only check out equipment, locations, or staff members that are not already busy with another event, and also allows
regular users to see what events they are signed up for as well as to see an overview of the organization's information.
The app also notifies users via email when they are added to an event as well as when they are added to the system
or change their password.

## Usage:

For administrators, the navbar contains links to add locations, users, items and events to the system. 
These will be displayed on the main dashboard, which has image links to navigate between information. These pages
also include the ability to update or remove information from the system (note that anything deleted will be gone forever).
