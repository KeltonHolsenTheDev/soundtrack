## Live site:

Coming Soon!!

## Description:

We want to build an event planning app that is specifically geared towards use in music events where sound equipment will need to be checked out and used. This app will track the equipment that an organization has and who is using it for what events, and will also allow event planners to track what members of a tech team are assigned to a given event.

## Usage:

Users will be able to check out equipment for their event on a first-come, first-serve basis depending on the time of the event. The app will also allow users to submit repair requests for equipment, removing it from the pool of available equipment until the administrator fulfills the repair ticket by fixing the equipment (we are assuming that the administrator is someone who handles repairs, as the app is primarily geared towards smaller organizations). The system will also be able to contact technicians to let them know about assignments for events.
